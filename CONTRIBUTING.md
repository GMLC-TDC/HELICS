## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for HELICS. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.  Frequently, helpful information includes operating system, version, compiler used, API, interface, and some details about the function or operation being performed.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting a feature request, or enhancement for HELICS, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

 Please include as much detail as possible including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed, and the rational and reasoning of why this feature would be a good idea for a co-simulation framework.

 A pull request including a bug fix or feature will always be welcome.

### Other repositories

There are a number of separate repositories included in the [GMLC-TDC organization](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC).  Please feel free to explore those repositories for examples and additional tools, and to contribute.  

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

-   check the issue list for any similar issues
-   take a look at the [RoadMap](ROADMAP.md) or projects to see if the feature is already planned, and if so feel free to add some feedback if it could be improved.


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to HELICS? You can start by looking for [`help wanted`](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) [`beginner`](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22beginner%22) issues:
Help with documentation and test cases is always welcome.  Take a look at the [code coverage reports](https://codecov.io/gh/GMLC-TDC/HELICS) for some ideas on places that need more testing

### Submitting a pull request
Typically you would want to submit a pull request against the develop branch.  That branch gets merged into master periodically but the develop branch is the active development branch where all the code is tested and merged before making a release.  There is a [Pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that will guide you through the needed information.  The pull requests are run through several automated checks in Travis and AppVeyor and for the most part must pass these tests before merging.  The Codacy check is evaluated but not required as the checks are sometimes a bit aggressive.

## Styleguides
Code formatting is controlled via clang-format, a somewhat higher level style guide can be found [here](https://helics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-guide/style.html). The code is not fully conformant to this yet but we are slowly working on it.
