## [1.1.1] - 2018-05-25
### Added
 - BrokerApp as a slightly more convenient runner to Brokers
 - getXXSize functions directly in the Subscription object instead of a roundabout call in the C api
 - more complete error catching for the C library
 - added helics-config executable for getting paths and links and used flags
 - added a broker app that can start up a broker easily

### Added
 - BrokerApp as a slightly more convenient runner to Brokers

### Changed
 - upgrade autobuild ZMQ version to 4.2.5 and change CMake scripts to use zmq target
 - updated HELICSConfig.cmake install file to link properly to external libraries and find them if necessary, also included some find functions.  The find_package(HELICS) should work properly now
 - changed boost inclusion to use targets instead of files directly
 - changed MPI inclusion to work better on windows and use targets instead of direct links
 - update cereal library with latest bug fixes
 - update jsoncpp with latest version
 - update cppzmq with the latest version
 - moved helics_broker executable code to the apps repository
 - the CXX shared library can now be built alongside the C shared library and can be built on Windows.

### Fixed
 - compilation issue with Xcode 8.0
 - inconsistent numerical conversion from vectors to doubles in subscriptions

### Removed
 - installation of HELICSImport.cmake  this is now redundant with updated HELICSConfig.cmake

## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-09
### Added
 - namedpoint functions in the C++ for publications and subscriptions, and corresponding functions in the C interface and language API's
 - Boolean publication and subscription for C++ interface, and corresponding functions in the C interface and language API's
 - new options for brokers, --local, --ipv4, --ipv6, --all,  are shortcuts for specifying external network interfaces
 - additional documentation, CONTRIBUTORS, ROADMAP, CONTRIBUTIONS, and some other other documentation improvements

### Changed
 - the default interface configuration for federates and brokers.  The --interface option is less important as interfaces should mostly get automatically determined by the broker address
 - minor configuration changes to CMAKE configuration to be more conforming with modern CMAKE best practices
 - cleaned up header installation for app directory
 - shared library construction now uses some headers generated by CMAKE

### Fixed
 - better error checking in the C interface
 - fixes for occasionally failing tests

## [1.0.3] - 2018-04-28
### Fixed
 - Fix bug preventing federates from terminating if its dependencies are disconnected and using purely interrupt driven timing, such as a recorder

## [1.0.2] - 2018-04-27
### Fixed
 - Bug not allowing command line parameters separate from the command if a positional argument was in usage
 - Fixed Bug for federate not allowing changes in period or minTimeDelay after entry to execution mode
 - added python2 interface option (this will be available but not fully capable going forward)
 - A few more race conditions fixed from clang thread-sanitizer

## [1.0.1] - 2018-04-22
### Fixed
 - Allow Boost 1.67 usage
 - allow building with AUTOBUILD for ZeroMQ on Linux
 - Clang tidy and static analyzer fixes
 - fix some potential race conditions spotted by clang thread-sanitizer
 - Fix some documentation to better match recent updates
