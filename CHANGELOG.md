# Changelog
All notable changes to this project after the 1.0.0 release will be documented in this file

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).  
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A note on future revisions.  
  Everything within a major version number should be code compatible (With the exception of experimental interfaces).  The most notable example of an experimental interface is the support for multiple source inputs.  The API's to deal with this will change in future minor releases.    Everything within a single minor release should be network compatible with other federates on the same minor release number.  Compatibility across minor release numbers may be possible in some situations but we are not going to guarantee this as those components are subject to performance improvements and may need to be modified at some point.  patch releases will be limited to bug fixes and other improvements not impacting the public API or network compatibility.  Check [here](./docs/Public_API.md) for details of what is included and excluded from the public API and version stability.


## [2.0.0] - 2019-02-12

This is a major revision so this changelog will not capture all the changes that have been made in detail. Some highlights:
  - major revision to the API including
    - use of an error object in the C api function instead of a return code.
    - better match the C++ api in terms of function names and layers.
    - The C++ api now uses objects for the interfaces instead of identification ids.
  - Filters can have multiple Targets
  - Define an input object which can be addressed from outside the federate
  - add a ZMQ_SS core type useful for large numbers of federates on a single machine.
  - add a TCP_SS socket for firewall usage though it may be applicable in other situations
  - numerous bug fixes and internal refactorings.
  - add target functions to the interface objects to add and remove targets
  - functions to allow cores and brokers to add links between federates
  - an octave interface
  - an early version of the C# interface.
  - an ability to set a global value (as a string) that can be queried.
  - a local info field for all the interfaces for user defined string data.  
  - many other small changes.
  - License file changed to match BSD-3-clause exactly(terms are the same but the file had some extra disclaimers in it, now it matches the standard BSD-3-clause license)
  - tag source files with

## [1.3.1] - 2018-09-23
### Changed
 - wait for Broker now uses a condition variable instead of sleep and checking repeatedly

### Fixed
 - some race conditions in a few test cases and in user disconnection calls for brokers
 - certain types of federates would occasionally hang during off nominal shutdown call sequences.  Fixing this led to a substantial rewrite of the tcp comms

### Added
 - federate, broker, and core destroy functions to the C api
 - tcp cores have a --reuse-address flag to allow multiple brokers on the same port,  mostly useful for the test suite to prevent spurious failures due to the OS not releasing tcp ports in a timely manner.  

### Changed
 - changed the logging levels to be error, warning, summary, connections, interfaces, timing, data, and trace to better match debugging levels used in development and make the purpose of each level clearer
 - comm objects now can use the same logging system as the rest of HELICS


## [1.3.0] - 2018-07-31
### Changed
 - some CMake options have been removed (BUILD_BROKER)
 - major changes to the build of the CTest testing Framework
 - moved most examples to new [HELICS-Examples](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Examples) Repo

### Fixed
 - potential segmentation fault in C shared library when calling free with invalid object.
 - autobuild recognizes build configuration

### Added
 - working octave interface for Linux
 - some additional tests for the shared library
 - TOML readers for interface description in Federates
 - interactive command line for helics_broker
 - a few new queries on brokers see [Queries](docs/user_guide/Queries.md)
 - CPACK can now build a dmg files
 - Players can have multiline comments in input file and omit the tag for repeated messages
 - marker option on player, recorder, tracer to print time advancement message

### Changed
 - added better code for allowing static runtime builds
 - use the cmake version numbers instead of independent variables
 - Environment variables are recognized in CMAKE find options
 - split API tests from system wide tests
 - added options on MSVC to build with embedded system libraries and embedded debug info.

### Removed
 - Most examples are now located in [HELICS-Examples](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Examples)

## [1.2.1] - 2018-06-30
### Fixed
 - bug in the conversion of named points from strings
 - MATLAB helicsSubscriptionGetVector function was producing a segmentation fault, now this is fixed
 - performance issue in the delay buffers of federateState
 - findMPI for MPI libraries with multiple libraries
 - federates will now error on missing required publications

### Added
 - first cut of MATLAB interface tests
 - some additional Java test cases
 - Python test cases for named point and bool tests
 - MATLAB helper scripts for loading the library
 - String length function for subscriptions

### Changed
 - conversion of doubles into the internal time base now rounds to the nearest ns instead of truncating
 - unify cmake scripts to use lower case commands

## [1.2.0] - 2018-06-18
### Fixed
 - issue with various filter types and random drop filters
 - a few minor issues with C API (helicsFederateSetMaxIterations)
 - potential threading issues when updating the logger on an executing federate
 - federates will now propagate errors properly for duplicate publications and endpoints
 - federates will now error on missing required publications

### Changed
 - implement use of FMT library instead of boost::format
 - improved python installation scripts
 - general threading and refactoring of the core
 - automatic name generation no longer uses random uuid's, but a shorter 20 fully character random string

### Added
 - queryCoreExecute, queryBrokerExecute to the C API to allow queries to be executed directly on brokers and cores
 - C++ API changes to for Brokers and Core to allow queries
 - Get StringLength function to the C and interface API
 - new queries (federate_map, and dependency_graph(partial))
 - additional filter tests and query tests
 - realtime mode for HELICS specified by activating the realtime flag, and specifying rt_lag and rt_lead  the federate will then delay grant or force_grant based on computer clock to match wall time.

## [1.1.1] - 2018-05-25
### Added
 - BrokerApp as a slightly more convenient runner to Brokers
 - getXXSize functions directly in the Subscription object instead of a roundabout call in the C api
 - more complete error catching for the C library
 - added helics-config executable for getting paths and links and used flags
 - added a broker app that can start up a broker easily

### Added
 - BrokerApp as a slightly more convenient runner to Brokers

### Changed
 - upgrade autobuild ZMQ version to 4.2.5 and change CMake scripts to use zmq target
 - updated HELICSConfig.cmake install file to link properly to external libraries and find them if necessary, also included some find functions.  The find_package(HELICS) should work properly now

## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-09
### Added
 - namedpoint functions in the C++ for publications and subscriptions, and corresponding functions in the C interface and language API's
 - Boolean publication and subscription for C++ interface, and corresponding functions in the C interface and language API's
 - new options for brokers, --local, --ipv4, --ipv6, --all,  are shortcuts for specifying external network interfaces
 - additional documentation, CONTRIBUTORS, ROADMAP, CONTRIBUTIONS, and some other other documentation improvements

### Changed
 - the default interface configuration for federates and brokers.  The --interface option is less important as interfaces should mostly get automatically determined by the broker address
 - minor configuration changes to CMAKE configuration to be more conforming with modern CMAKE best practices
 - cleaned up header installation for app directory
 - shared library construction now uses some headers generated by CMAKE

### Fixed
