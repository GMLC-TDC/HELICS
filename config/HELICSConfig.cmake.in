# HELICS cmake module
# This module sets the following variables in your project::
#
#   HELICS_FOUND - true if HELICS found on the system
#   HELICS_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing HELICS headers for the C shared library if available
#   HELICS_C_SHARED_LIBRARY - the C shared library
#   HELICS_CXX_SHARED_LIBRARY -the C++ shared library
#   It also creates the following targets if they are available (not all are always built depending on the configuration)
#   HELICS::helicsSharedLib for the C based shared library
#   HELICS::helics-shared for C++ based shared libary
#   HELICS::cpp98 for the C++98 header only library wrapper for the C shared library
#   HELICS::helics_player is an execuable target for the HELICS player
#   HELICS::helics_broker is an executable target for the helics broker executable
#   HELICS::helics_recorder is an executable target for the helics_recorder executable
#   HELICS::helics_app is an executable target for the helics_app executable
#   HELICS::helics_broker_server is an executable target for the helics_broker_server executable
#   HELICS::helics-config is a an executable target for the helics-config application
