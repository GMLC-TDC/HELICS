      # If steps.calibre.outputs.markdown != '' then images were compressed.
      # An additional enhancement would be to check if the PR was from a fork and post a message saying how much space can be saved with compression.
      # For pushes to some branches, opening a PR with the compressed files could be good (ideally before the images have been merged into the main branch).
