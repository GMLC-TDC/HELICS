The Echo application is one of the HELICS apps available with the library
Its purpose is to provide a easy way to generate an echo response to a message
Mainly for testing and demos

the echo executable also takes an untagged argument of a file name for example
```

```

The Echo app supports JSON files some examples can be found in

[Echo configuration examples](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS/tree/master/tests/helics/apps/test_files)

the main property of the echo app is the delay time which messages are echoed.
