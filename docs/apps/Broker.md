If the Broker is started with `term` as the first option, a terminal is opened for user entry of commands all command line arguments following term are passed to the broker.

```bash
starting broker
helics>>help
`quit` -> close the terminal application and wait for broker to finish
`terminate` -> force the broker to stop
`terminate*` -> force the broker to stop and exit application
`help`,`?` -> this help display
`restart` -> restart a completed broker
`status` -> will display the current status of the broker
`info` -> will display info about the broker
`force restart` -> will force terminate a broker and restart it
`query` <queryString> -> will query a broker for <queryString>
`query` <queryTarget> <queryString> -> will query <queryTarget> for <queryString>
helics>>
```

`status` will print out current status of the brokers including counts of federates, brokers, and handles

```bash
helics>>status
Broker (643204-ibrVd-14EWH-unKfh-hExUP) is connected and is accepting new federates
{"brokers":0,
"federates":0,
"handles":0}
helics>>
```

info prints out name, connection status, and connection information

```bash
helics>>info
Broker (643204-ibrVd-14EWH-unKfh-hExUP) is connected and is accepting new federates
address=tcp://127.0.0.1:23404
```

The `query` command allows any query to be executed from the command line, `query counts` displays the same count numbers as `status`.

Other available queries are described in [Queries](../user-guide/queries.html).

various restart options are also available, `terminate`, `restart`, `force restart`. And finally `quit` will exit the terminal and wait for the broker to complete. enter `terminate` before quit or `terminate*` to terminate and quit.
