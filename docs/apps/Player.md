Player
=======

The player application is one of the HELICS apps available with the library
Its purpose is to provide a easy way to generate data into a federation
It acts as a federate that can "play" values or messages at specific times
It exists as a standalone executable but also as library object so could be integrated
into other components

Command line arguments
----------
```
command line only:
  -? [ --help ]          produce help message
  -v [ --version ]       display a version string
  --config-file arg      specify a configuration file to use

configuration:
  --local                specify otherwise unspecified endpoints and
                         publications as local( i.e.the keys will be prepended
                         with the player name
  --stop arg             the time to stop the player
  --quiet                turn off most display output

  --timedelta arg        the time delta of the federate
  --rttolerance arg      the time tolerance of the real time mode
  -i [ --coreinit ] arg  the core initialization string
  --separator arg        separator character for local federates
  --inputdelay arg       the input delay on incoming communication of the
                         federate
  --outputdelay arg      the output delay for outgoing communication of the
                         federate
  -f [ --flags ] arg     named flag for the federate

allowed options:

configuration:
  --datatype arg         type of the publication data type to use
  --marker arg           print a statement indicating time advancement every  arg seconds
                         is the period of the marker
  --time_units arg        the default units on the timestamps used in file based
                         input


```
also permissible are all arguments allowed for federates and any specific broker specified:

[Command line reference](cmdArgs.html)

the player executable also takes an untagged argument of a file name for example
```
helics_player player_file.txt --stop 5
```

Players support both delimited text files and JSON files some examples can be found in

## Config File Detail

### publications
a simple example of a player file publishing values
```
#second    topic                type(opt)                    value
-1.0, pub1, d, 0.3
1, pub1, 0.5
3, pub1 0.8
2, pub1 0.7
# pub 2
1, pub2, d, 0.4
2, pub2, 0.6
3, pub2, 0.9
4, 0.7  # this statement is assumed to refer to pub 2
```
`#` signifies a comment
the first column is time in seconds unless otherwise specified via the `--time_units` flag or other configuration means
the second column is publication name
the final column is the value
the optional third column specifies a type valid types are

time specifications are typically numerical with optional units
`5` or `"500 ms"` or `23.7us` if there is a space between the number and units it must be enclosed in quotes
if no units are specified the time defaults to units specified via `--time_units` or seconds if none were specified
valid units are "s", "ms", "us", "min", "day", "hr", "ns", "ps" the default precision in HELICS is ns so time specified in ps is not guaranteed to be precise

```eval_rst
+--------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
| identifier         | type                      | Example               |
+====================+===========================+=======================+
| d,f, double        | double                    | 45.1                  |
+--------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
| s,string           | string                    | "this is a test"      |

| v, vector          | vector of doubles         | [23.1,34,17.2,-5.6]   |
+--------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
| cv, complex_vector | vector of complex numbers | [23+2j, -23.1j, 1+3i] |
+--------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
```

capitalization does not matter

values with times <0 are sent during the initialization phase
values with time==0 are sent immediately after entering execution phase

### Messages
messages are specified in one of two forms
```
m <time> <source> <dest>  <data>
```
or
```
m <sendtime> <deliverytime> <source> <dest> <time> <data>
```

the second option allows sending events at a different time than they are triggered
the data portion of messages can be encoded in base64 by marking as b64[<data>] or base64[X]  all data between the brackets will be converted to raw binary.  A ']' must be last

### JSON configuration
player values can also be specified via JSON files

here are two examples of the text format and equivalent JSON
```
#example player file
mess 1.0 src dest "this is a test message"
mess 1.0 2.0 src dest "this is test message2"
M 2.0 3.0 src dest "this is message 3"
```
JSON example
```
 {
	"messages": [{
			"source": "src",
			"dest": "dest",
			"time": 1.0,
			"data":"this is a test message"
		}, {
  			"source": "src",
  			"dest": "dest",
  			"time": 1.0,
        "encoding":"base64"
  			"data":AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODxAREhMUFRYXGBkaGxwdHh8gISIjJCUmJygpKissLS4vMDEyMzQ1Njc4OTo7PD0+P0BBQkNERUZHSElKS0xNTk9QUVJTVFVWV1hZWltcXV5fYGFiY2RlZmdoaWprbG1ub3BxcnN0dXZ3eHl6e3x9fn+AgYKDhIWGh4iJiouMjY6PkJGSk5SVlpeYmZqbnJ2en6ChoqOkpaanqKmqq6ytrq+wsbKztLW2t7i5uru8vb6/wMHCw8TFxsfIycrLzM3Oz9DR0tPU1dbX2Nna29zd3t/g4eLj5OXm5+jp6uvs7e7v8PHy8/T19vf4+fr7/P3+/w=="
  		},{

			"dest": "dest",
			"time": 2.0,
			"data":"this is test message2"
		}, {
			"source": "src",
			"dest": "dest",
			"time": 3.0,
			"data":"this is message 3"
		}
	]
}
```

```
#second    topic                type(opt)                    value
-1 pub1 d 0.3
1 pub1 d 0.5
2 pub1 d 0.7
3 pub1 d 0.8
1 pub2 d 0.4
2 pub2 d 0.6
3 pub2 d 0.9
```
Example JSON
```
{
	"points": [{
			"key": "pub1",
			"type": "double",
			"value": 0.3,
			"time": -1
		}, {

			"key": "pub2",
			"type": "double",
			"value": 0.4,
			"time": 1.0
		}, {
			"key": "pub1",
			"value": 0.5,
			"time": 1.0
		},
		{
			"key": "pub1",
			"value": 0.8,
			"time": 3.0
		},
		{
			"key": "pub1",
			"value": 0.7,
			"time": 2.0
		},
		{
			"key": "pub2",
			"value": 0.6,
			"time": 2.0
		},
		{
			"key": "pub2",
			"value": 0.9,
			"time": 3.0
		}
	]
}
```

some configuration can also be done through JSON through elements of "stop","local","separator","time_units"
and file elements can be used to load up additional files
