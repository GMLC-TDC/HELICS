[verse]
'helics_app clone' [-v|--version] [-h|-?|--help]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The clone application provides an easy way to clone a federate for later playback.
It can "capture" values or messages from a single federate and store them with
timestamps for later playback. The output playback file for use with the
helics_app-player(1) tries to match the original timing of messages, publications,
and subscriptions as closely as possible.

OPTIONS
-------
<capture>::
        The name of the federate to clone.

--allow_iteration::
        Allow iteration on values.

-o::
--output <file>::
        The output file to use for recording the data.
        The default file used is clone.json if this option
        isn't given.
