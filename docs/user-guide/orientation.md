# Orientation

There are a number of classes of HELICS users:

- **New users** that have little to no experience with HELICS and co-simulation in general
	- Start with [**Installation**](../installation/index.md)
	- Read the [**Fundamental Topics**](./index.html#fundamental-topics)
	- Try the [**Examples**](./index.html#examples)	
- **Intermediate users** that have run co-simulations with HELICS using simulators in which somebody else implemented the HELICS support
- **Experienced users** that are incorporating a new simulator and need to know how to use specific features in the HELICS API
	- Look in the [**Configurations Options Reference**](./index.html#configurations-options-reference) or jump straight to the API references
- **Developers** of HELICS who are improving HELICS functionality and contributing to the code base
	- See the [**Developer Guide**](../developer-guide.md)
