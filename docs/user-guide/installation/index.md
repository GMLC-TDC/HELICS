# Installation

The first step to using HELICS is to install it. Since there are several ways to do this, the flow chart below provides some insight into what approach is likely to be the easiest depending upon a number of factors, most predominantly the programming language bindings that you intend to use. Below the flow chart you'll provide links to more complete instructions for each method. Note that you’ll need an internet connection for this process, as we’ll be downloading HELICS from the internet.
