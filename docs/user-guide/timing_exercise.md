# Exercises in Co-simulation timing
A few simple exercises about co-simulation timing

## Key Parameters

-   **Period**: The minimum time resolution a federate will allow.  
-   **Offset**: a shift in the period.  Allowed times for federate grants after time 0 are `offset+N*period`, where `N` is a non-negative integer.
-   **Time_delta**: the minimum time between grants, i.e. if a federate is granted time T, the next possible time is `T+Time_delta`.  

## Modifier Flags

-   **Uninteruptible**: a federate can only be granted requested times
-   **wait_for_current_time_update**:  specify that a federate should wait until all federates executing at the current time have finished.

1.  Federation Setup \[A:  period=1; B:  period=2; C:  period=3\]

    a. 	Following time 0, which federate could execute next? `___________________________`

    b. 	If all federates execute at all allowed times, what is the next time Federate B could have access to data from Federate C.  `__________________`

    c. 	What is the next time all federate will be able to execute simultaneously? `__________________`

     **Key Principle**:  *Federates are interrupted if there is updated data available and allowed time prior to the requested time*

2.   Federation Setup \[A:  period=1,`wait_for_current_time_update`; B:  period=2; C:  period=3\]

     a.	At what time will the data from Federate B published at time 2, be available to Federate A? `______________`

     b.	Federate A requests time 4:  Federate B publishes at time 2.  What time is Federate A granted? `_____________`

     c.	Federate A requests time 2:  Federate B publishes at time 2. What time does Federate A receive the data? `_________________`

     e.	If A did not have the `wait_for_current_time_update` flag active, what time would Federate A receive the data? `________________`


     **Key Principle**:  *Federates are granted the next allowed time after the time specified in a request if they are not interrupted.*

3.   Federation Setup \[A:  period=1; B:  period=2,offset=1,time_delta=2; C:  period=3\]

     a.	After time=0 what is the next allowable time for Federate B? `_______________`

     b.	Federate C requested a time of 4, what time is Federate C granted? `_______________`

4.  Federation Setup \[A:  period=1; B:  period=2,uninterruptible; C:  period=3\]

    a.	Federate C Publishes at time 3,  Federate B requests time 6, what time will it be granted?`______________`

    b.	If Federate B were not uninterruptible what time would it be granted? `_______________`

5.  Federation Setup \[A:  period=1; B:  period=2; C:  period=3\], Federates will send an update when they have received an update from the all other connected federates.  Federate A sends an update at time 0, what is the update sequence
