# User Guide #

Co-simulation is a powerful analysis technique that allows simulators of different domains to interact through the course of the simulation, typically by dynamically exchanging values that define boundary conditions for other simulators. HELICS is a co-simulation platform that has been designed to allow integration of these simulators across a variety of computation platforms and languages. HELICS has been designed with power system simulation in mind ([GridLAB-D](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d), [GridDyn](https://github.com/LLNL/GridDyn), [MATPOWER](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/MATPOWER-wrapper), [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/), [PSLF](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/PSLF-wrapper), [InterPSS](https://github.com/InterPSS-Project/ipss-common), [FESTIV](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/festiv-model.html)) but is general enough to support a wide variety of simulators and co-simulation tasks. Support for other domains is anticipated to increase over time.

## Who Is This User Guide For? ##
There are a number of classes of HELICS users:

*   New users that have little to no experience with HELICS and co-simulation in general
*   Intermediate users that have run co-simulations with HELICS using simulators in which somebody else implemented the HELICS support
*   Experienced users that are incorporating a new simulator and need to know how to use specific features in the HELICS API
*   Developers of HELICS who are improving HELICS functionality and contributing to the code base
