intro text which describes the examples covered -- 
the first example is the base model - all other examples build off this model.
find the source code on github *here*, clone/etc

permutations of the examples -- integration of federates, communication, 
table? image?

what does each cover?

1. base model with this configuration - xyz

-- follows the co-sim sequence framework in the explanation

2.  federate integration -- how to integrate a bespoke federate using the API instead of the json
 
3. message + communication configuration

-- sub topics:

* endpoints
* endpoints+pub/sub (combo fed)
