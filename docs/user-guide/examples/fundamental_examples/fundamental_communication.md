# Federate Message + Communication Configuration




In the [Base Example](./fundamental_default.md), we saw information passed between two federates using publications and subscriptions (pubs/subs). In addition to pubs/subs, where information is passed as *values* (physical parameters of the system), federates can also pass information between **endpoints**, where this information is now a *message*.

This section on message and communication configuration will walk through how to set up two federates to pass messages using [endpoints](./fundamental_endpoints.md), and how to set up three federates which pass between them values and messages with a [combination](./fundamental_combo.md) of the two configurations.
