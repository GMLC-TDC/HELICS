# Combination Federation

The Federate Message + Communication Configuration Example extends the Base Example to demonstrate how to register federates which can send/receive messages from endpoints and values from pub/subs.

This tutorial is organized as follows:

* [Computing Environment](#computing-environment)
* [Example files](#example-files)  
* [Combination Federation](#combination-federation)
	* [When to use pub/subs vs endpoints](#when-to-use-pub-subs-vs-endpoints)
	* [Translation from pub/sub to endpoints](#translation-from-pub-sub-to-endpoints)
	* [Co-simulation Execution](co-simulation-execution)
* [Questions and Help](#questions-and-help)
