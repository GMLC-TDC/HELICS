# Examples in Supported Languages

## User Guide Advanced Default Example

The User Guide Examples are primarily written in Python due to its popularity but HELICS provides language bindings for many other languages. To demonstrate this, [one of the examples](../advanced_examples/advanced_default) has been written in each of the supporting languages to show how the APIs look in each of those languages but achieve similar functionality.
