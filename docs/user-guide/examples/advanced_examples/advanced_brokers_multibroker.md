# Brokers - Multi-Protocol Brokers

This example shows how to configure a HELICS co-simulation to implement a broker structure that utilizes multiple core types in a single co-simulation. Typically, all federates in a single federation use the same core type (ZMQ by default) but HELICS can be set up to utilize different core types in the same federation

## What is this co-simulation doing?

This example shows you how to configure a co-simulation to use more than one core type in the same federation. The example itself has the same functionality as the Advanced Default example as the only change is a structural to the federation and not the federate code itself.

### Differences compared to the Advanced Default example

For this example, the [Advanced Default example](./advanced_default.md) has been split up so that each federate uses a different core type in a single federation.

#### HELICS differences

Typically, all federates in a federation use the same core type. There can be cases, though, where a multi-site co-simulation with a more complex networking environment or performance requirements dictate the need for some federates to utilize a difference core type than others. For example, the `IPC` core utilizes a Boost library function to allow two executables both using Boost to communicate between themselves when running on the same compute node; since this is in-memory communication rather than over the network stack, performance is expected to be higher. It could be that a particular federation has been optimized to take advantage of this but must also communicate with federates on a separate compute node via ZMQ. In this case, a so-called "multibroker" can be configured to allow for the federation to run. (See the User Guide section on the [multi-protocol broker](../../advanced_topics/broker_hierarchies.md) and [broker core types](../../advanced_topics/CoreTypes.md) for further details.)

In this example, we won't be doing anything like that but, for demonstration purposes, simply using the same federation from the [Advanced Default example.](./advanced_default.md) and configuring it so each federate uses a different core type.

### HELICS Components

To configure a multibroker, the broker configuration line is slightly extended from a traditional federation. From the HELICS runner configuration file `multi_broker_runner.json`

```json
"exec": "helics_broker -f 3 --coreType=multi --config=multi_broker_config.json --name=root_broker",
```

The `coreType` of the broker is set to `multi` and a configuration file is specified. That file looks like this:

```json
{
  "master": {
    "coreType": "test"
  },
  "comms": [
    {
      "coreType": "zmq",
      "port": 23500
    },
    {
      "coreType": "tcp",
      "port": 23700
    },
    {
      "coreType": "udp",
      "port": 23900
    }
  ]
}
```

The first and most important note: `master` and `comms` are reserved words in this context and **MUST** be used. The `master` core type must be `test` but the core types for the federates can be any of the supported cores. Again, as in [other](./advanced_brokers_hierarchies.md) [similar](./advanced_brokers_simultaneous.md) examples, because we are running this on a single compute node, the port for each core type must be specified and the federates using those core types need to have the `brokerPort` property set to the corresponding core's port number.

BatteryConfig.json

```json
  "name": "Battery",
  "loglevel": 1,
  "coreType": "zmq",
  "brokerPort": 23500,
```

ChargerConfig.json

```json
  "name": "Charger",
  "loglevel": 1,
  "coreType": "tcp",
  "brokerPort": 23700,
```

ControllerConfig.json

```json
  "name": "Controller",
  "loglevel": 1,
  "coreType": "udp",
  "brokerPort": 23900,
```

## Execution and Results

Unlike the other advanced broker examples, this one can be run with a single HELICS runner command:

```shell-session
$ helics run --path=./multi_broker_runner.json
```

As has been mentioned, since this is just a change to the co-simulation architecture, the results are identical to those in the [Advanced Default example.](./advanced_default.md)
