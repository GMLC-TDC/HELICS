# GridLAB-D Example 1

This example is from an old version of the User Guide and shows how GridLAB-D can be used with HELICS to implement functionality that would otherwise not be possible without editing GridLAB-D source code. The example repeats some of the material in the [Fundamentals section of the User Guide](../../../fundamental_topics/fundamental_topics_index.md) but, by including GridLAB-D, provides a more concrete example of how to use HELICS to answer power system problems.
