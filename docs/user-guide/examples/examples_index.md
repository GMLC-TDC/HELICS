The examples provided in the user guide begin with a simple co-simulation that you should be able to execute with only python and HELICS installed. If you have not installed HELICS yet, navigate to the [**installation page**](../installation/index.md).

## What are we modeling?

The model for the examples is a co-simulation of a number of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and a charging port. A researcher may pose the question, "What is the state of charge of batteries on board EVs as they charge connected to a charging port?"

This can be addressed with a simple two-federate co-simulation, as demonstrated in the Fundamental Examples, or with a more complicated multi-federate co-simulation modeled in the Advanced Examples. In each learning path, modules are provided to the user to demonstrate a skill. The Advanced Examples build on the basics to make the co-simulation better emulate reality.
