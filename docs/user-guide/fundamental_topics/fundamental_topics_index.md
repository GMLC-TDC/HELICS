what do we mean by 'fundamental topics' ?
what are the learning objectives?
by the end of this section, you should be able to...
provide context with examples

give narrative intro to topics introduced in this section
```

- [**HELICS Terminology**](./helics_terminology) - Key terms and concepts to understand before running co-simulations with HELICS
- [**Federates**](./federates.md) - Discussion of the different types of federates in HELICS and how to configure them.
- [**Federate Interface Configuration**](./interface_configuration.md) - How to connect an existing simulator with HELICS
	- **With JSON config file**
	- **With HELICS APIs**
- [**Timing**](./timing.md) - How HELICS coordinates the simulation time of all the federates in the federation
- [**Stages of the Co-simulation**](./stages.md)
- [**Logging**](./logging.md) - Discussion of logging within HELICS and how to control it.
- [**(Launch) Execution with `helics_cli`**](./helics_cli.md) - The HELICS team has developed `helics_cli` as a standardized means of running HELICS co-simulations.
- [**Simulation Management**](./web_interface.md) - Using the webserver, HELICS also has a built-in web interface for running, monitoring, and diagnosing co-simulations.
