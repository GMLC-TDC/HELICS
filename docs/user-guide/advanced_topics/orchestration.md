# Orchestration

The goal of this guide is to show and guide you how to handle
co-simulation orchestration. We will walk through using a specific
tool ([merlin](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin)) that has tested with
HELICS co-simulations. This is not the only tool that exist that has
this capability and is not a requirement if all you want to achieve
co-simulation orchestration. One advantage that Merlin has, is its
ability to interface with HPC systems that have SLURM or Flux as their
resource managers.

## Definition of "Orchestration" in HELICS

We will define the term "orchestration" within HELICS as workflow and
deployment. This will allow users to define a co-simulation workflow
they would like to execute and deploy the co-simulation either on
their own machine or in an HPC environment.

## What you will need

First you will need to build and install
[merlin](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin). This guide will walk through
a suggested co-simulation spec using merlin to launch a HELICS
co-simulation. This is not a comprehensive guide on how to use merlin,
but a guide to use merlin for HELICS co-simulation orchestration. For
a full guide on how to use merlin, please refer to the merlin
[tutorial](https://merlin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).

### Merlin

Merlin is a distributed task queuing system, designed to allow complex
HPC workflows to scale to large numbers of simulations. It is designed
to make building, running, and processing large scale HPC
workflows. It is not limited to HPC, it can also be setup on a single
machine.

Merlin translates a command-line focused workflow into discrete tasks
that it will queue up and launch. This workflow is called a
specification, spec for short. The spec is separated into multiple
sections that is used to describe how to execute the workflow. This
workflow is then represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which
describes how the workflow executes.

Once the Merlin spec has been created, the main execution logic is
contained in the Study step. This step describes how the applications
or scripts need to be executed in the commandline in order to execute
your workflow. The study step is made up of multiple run steps that
are represented as the nodes in the DAG.

For a more in-depth explanation on how Merlin works, take a look at
their documentation [here](https://merlin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Merlin Specification

A merlin specification has multiple parts that control how a
co-simulation may run. Below we describe how each part can be used in
a HELICS co-simulation workflow. For the sake of simplicity we are
using the the pi-exchange python example that can be found
[here](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Examples/tree/master/python/pi-exchange). The
goal will be to have merlin launch multiple pi-senders and
pi-recievers.

#### Merlin workflow description and environment
Merlin has a description and and environment block. The description block,
describes the name and a short description about the study.
```
description:
    name: Test helics 
    description: Juggle helics data
```

The env block describes the environment that the study will execute
in. This is a place where you can set environment variables to control
the number of federates you may need in your co-simulation.

```
env:
  variables:
    OUTPUT_PATH: ./helics_juggle_output
    N_SAMPLES: 8
```

In the example above ```N_SAMPLES``` will be used to describe how many
pi-senders and pi-receivers we want in our co-simulation.



#### Merlin Step

The merlin step can simply be summarized as the input data generation
step. This step describes how to create the initial inputs for the
co-simulation so that subsquent steps can use this input to start the
co-simulation. Below is how we might describe the merlin step for our
pi-exchange study.

```
merlin:
  samples:
    generate:
      cmd: |
        python3 $(SPECROOT)/make_samples.py $(N_SAMPLES) $(MERLIN_INFO)
        cp $(SPECROOT)/pireceiver.py $(MERLIN_INFO)
        cp $(SPECROOT)/pisender.py $(MERLIN_INFO)
    file: samples.csv
    column_labels: [FED]
	
NOTE: samples.csv is generated by make_samples.py. Each line in
samples.csv is the name of the json fils that is created.

```

There is a python script called ```make_samples.py``` that generates
all helics-cli json configs that will be executed by helics-cli that
will be used to execute the co-simulations. ```N_SAMPLES``` is an
environment variable that is set to 8, so in this example 8
pireceivers and 8 pisenders will be created and used in this
co-simulations. ```make_samples.py``` also outputs the name of each
json file to a csv file called ```samples.csv```. ```samples.csv```
contains the names of the json files that were generated. The
```column_labels``` tag tells merlin to set each column in
```samples.csv``` to ```[FED]```. This means we can use ```FED``` as a
variable in the study step. Below is an example of one of the json files that is
created.

```
{
    "federates": [
        {
            "directory": ".",
            "exec": "python3 -u pisender.py 0",
            "host": "localhost",
            "name": "pisender0"
        }
    ],
    "name": "pisender0"
}
```
This json file will then be used as the input file for helics-cli. The
helics-cli will be executed in the study step in merlin which we will
go over next.

#### Study Step

The study step is where merlin will execute all the steps specified in
the block. Each step is denoted by a name and has a run segment. The
run segment is where you will tell merlin what commands need to be
executed.

```
    - name: start_federates <-- Name of the step
      description: say Hello 
      run:
        cmd: |
          helics run --path=$(FED) <-- execute the helics_cli for each column in samples.csv
          echo "DONE"

```
In the example snippet we ask Merlin to execute the json file that was
created in the merlin step. Since the ```FED``` variable is a list,
this command will get executed for each index in ```FED```.

### Full Spec

Below is the full Merlin spec that was created to make 8 pi-receivers
and 8 pi-senders and execute it as a merlin workflow.

```
description:
    name: Test helics 
    description: Juggle helics data

env:
  variables:
    OUTPUT_PATH: ./helics_juggle_output
    N_SAMPLES: 8


merlin:
  samples:
    generate:
      cmd: |
        python3 $(SPECROOT)/make_samples.py $(N_SAMPLES) $(MERLIN_INFO)
        cp $(SPECROOT)/pireceiver.py $(MERLIN_INFO)
        cp $(SPECROOT)/pisender.py $(MERLIN_INFO)
    file: samples.csv
    column_labels: [FED]


study:
    - name: start_federates
      description: say Hello 
      run:
        cmd: |
          spack load helics
          /home/yee29/projects/helics/helics-cli/bin/helics run --path=$(FED)
          echo "DONE"
    - name: cleanup
      description: Clean up
      run:
        cmd: rm $(SPECROOT)/samples.csv
        depends: [start_federates_*]
```

### Why Merlin

The biggest feature that Merlin will give HELICS users it ability to
deploy co-simulations in an HPC environment. Merlin has the ability to
interface with both FLUX and SLURM workload managers that are
installed on HPC machines. Merlin will handle the request for
allocation and job and task distribution amongst the nodes. Users will
not need to know how to use SLURM or FLUX because Merlin will handle
all resource allocation calls to the workload manager, the user will
only need to provide the number of nodes they need for their study.

Another benefit of using Merlin for HELICS co-simulation is its
flexibility to manage complex co-simulation. Another tool that you may
have heard of is helics_cli. Helics_cli is a commandline tool to launch
HELICS co-simulations. It currently as of this writing does not have
the ability to analyze the data and launch subsequent co-simulations
if need. In this type of scenario a user could use Merlin to setup a
specification that included an analyze step in the Study step of
Merlin. The analysis step would determine the input of the next
co-simulation if another co-simulation was needed and would then
proceed to launch the co-simulation with the input generated by the
analysis step
