# Package Manager

## Install using conda (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

**Recommended**

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). It is a Python distribution but also provides a cross platform package manager called `conda`.

You can then use `conda` to install HELICS.

```bash
conda install -c gmlc-tdc helics
```
