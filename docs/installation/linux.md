Ubuntu Installation
===================

Requirements
------------

* Ubuntu 16 or newer
* C++11 compiler (C++14 preferred)
* CMake 3.4 or newer
* git
* Boost 1.58 or newer
* ZeroMQ 4.1.4 or newer (if ZeroMQ support is needed)
* [for future versions] OpenMPI v8 or newer (if MPI support is needed)

Setup
-----

To set up your environment:

1. Install dependencies using apt-get.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-date-time-dev
sudo apt-get install libzmq5-dev
```

2. Make sure *cmake* and *git* are available in the Command Prompt. If they aren't, add them to the system PATH variable.

Getting and building from source:

1. Use `git clone` to to check out a copy of HELICS.

2. Create a build folder. Run cmake and give it the path that HELICS was checked out into.

3. Run "make".

```bash

git clone https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src
cd HELICS-src
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
ccmake . # optional, to change install path or other configuration settings
make
make install
```

Testing
-------

A quick test is to double check the versions of the HELICS player and recorder:

```bash
cd /path/to/helics_install/bin

$ helics_player --version
0.1

$ helics_recorder --version
0.1
```
