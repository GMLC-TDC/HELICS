# Windows Installation


## Requirements

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer (MS Build Tools also works)
- CMake 3.4 or newer
- git
- Boost 1.58 or newer
- ZeroMQ 4.2.0 or newer (if ZeroMQ support is needed)
- MS-MPI v8 or newer (if MPI support is needed)

## Setup

To set up your environment:

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer
2. Install
   [Boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/more/getting_started/windows.html)
    [Windows downloads](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.66.0/binaries/)
   1.61 or later recommended (core library should build with 1.58,
   but tests will not). For CMake to detect it automatically either
   extract Boost to the root of your drive, or set the BOOST\_INSTALL\_PATH
   environment variable to the install location. The cmake will only automatically find
    boost 1.61 or newer.
   Building with Visual Studio 2017 will require boost 1.65.1 or newer and cmake 3.9
    or newer.  Use 14.0 versions for Visual Studio 2015, 14.1 files for Visual studio 2017.
    Boost 1.66 with cmake 3.11 is the current recommended configuration.
3. *Optional* Install [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/build:_start) if you
   need ZeroMQ support and need a copy in a global system location.
   We recommend skipping this step and running cmake with the
   `AUTOBUILD_ZMQ=ON` option to automatically set up a project-only
   copy of ZeroMQ later on. The ZeroMQ Windows installer is **very**
   outdated and will not work with new versions of Visual Studio.
4. *Optional* Install
   [MS-MPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx)
   if you need MPI support.
5. *Optional* Install
   [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/download.html)
   if you wish to generate the interface libraries, appropriate build files are
    included in the repository so it shouldn't be necessary to regenerate unless the libraries are modified
6. Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt, and go to your working
   directory.
7. Make sure *cmake* and *git* are available in the Command Prompt.
   If they aren't, add them to the system PATH variable.

Getting and building from source:

1. Set up your environment.
2. Open a command prompt. Use git clone to check out a copy of
   HELICS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src.git
```

3. Go to the checkedout HELICS project folder (the default folder
   name is HELICS-src). Create a build folder and open the build
   folder. Alternatively, cmake-gui can be used.

```bash
cd HELICS-src
mkdir build
cd build
```

4. Run cmake. It should automatically detect where MPI is installed
   if the system path variables are set up correctly, otherwise you
   will have to set the cmake path manually. The AUTOBUILD_ZMQ is set to ON
    so ZeroMQ will automatically be built unless the option is changed.

```bash
cmake ..
```

If you need cmake to use a generator other than the default (ex:
selecting between a 32-bit or 64-bit project), the -G option can be
used to specify one of the generators listed by cmake --help. For
Visual Studio 2017, the generator name would be
`Visual Studio 15 2017 [arch]`, where \[arch\] is optional and can be
either Win64 for a 64-bit project, or left out to generate a 32-bit
project. To avoid problems when building later, this should match the
version of the Boost libraries you are using.

If you installed boost into the root of the C or D drives with the
default localtion (or the BOOST\_INSTALL\_PATH environment variable has been set),
cmake should automatically detect their location. Otherwise the
location will need to be manually given to cmake.

5. Open the Visual Studio solution generated by CMake. Under the
   *Build* menu, select *Build the Solution*. Alternatively, in the
   MSBuild command prompt, run the command msbuild HELICS.sln from
   the build folder to compile the entire solution. HELICS.sln can be
   replaced with the name of one of the projects to build only that
   part of HELICS.

## Windows Installers

Windows installers are available with the different [releases](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src/releases).  The release includes installers for the Debug version and Release version. As well as a zip file of the install directory. The static libraries included with the installer will work with Visual Studio 2017.  

## Testing

A quick test is to double check the versions of the HELICS player and
recorder (located in the 'build\src\helics\apps\player\Debug' folder):

```bash
> cd C:\Path\To\build\src\helics\apps\Debug

> helics_player.exe --version
1.0.2 04-28-2018

> helics_recorder.exe --version
1.0.2 04-28-2018
```

## Building HELICS with python support

Setting `-DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON` will generate a project to build the python interface, if python is installed to a system
path then the appropriate libraries and flags will be automatically found.  If SWIG is available and you wish to regenerate the interface
set SWIG\_EXECUTABLE to the location of swig.exe.  Otherwise DISABLE\_SWIG can be set to ON to build using repo sources for the interface.
We highly recommend using Anaconda3/Miniconda3 for the Python distribution.
Additionally, you will need to ensure that the Python distribution used is built using the same compiler architecture (x86/x64) as the one you are using to build HELICS, as well as the one that was used to build Boost (as mentioned above).
ZeroMQ will be built using the CMake build process.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\local\helics-v1.0.0"  -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
otherwise they can be set through CMAKE flags
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\local\helics-v1.0.0"  -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python3-config --prefix)\include\python3.6m\ -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python3-config --prefix)\lib\python3.6m\libpython3.6m.dll ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

Add the following to the Windows PYTHONPATH environment variable or run the following in the command line.

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=C:\local\helics-v1.0.2\python;%PYTHONPATH%
```

If you open a interactive Python session and import helics, you should be able to get the version of `helics` and an output that is similar to the following.

```bash
$ ipython
Python 3.6.4 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Jan 16 2018, 12:04:33)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: import helics

In [2]: helics.helicsGetVersion()
Out[2]: '1.0.2 (04-28-18)'

```
