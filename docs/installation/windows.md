Windows Installation
====================

Requirements
------------

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer (MS Build Tools also works)
- CMake 3.4 or newer
- git
- Boost 1.58 or newer
- ZeroMQ 4.2.0 or newer (if ZeroMQ support is needed)
- MS-MPI v8 or newer (if MPI support is needed)

Setup
-----

To set up your environment:

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer
2. Install
   [Boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/more/getting_started/windows.html)
   1.61 or later recommended (core library should build with 1.58,
   but tests will not). For CMake to detect it automatically either
   extract Boost to the root of your drive, or set the BOOST\_ROOT
   environment variable to the install location.
3. *Optional* Install [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/build:_start) if you
   need ZeroMQ support and need a copy in a global system location.
   We recommend skipping this step and running cmake with the
   `AUTOBUILD_ZMQ=ON` option to automatically set up a project-only
   copy of ZeroMQ later on. The ZeroMQ Windows installer is **very**
   outdated and will not work with new versions of Visual Studio.
4. *Optional* Install
   [MS-MPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx)
   if you need MPI support.
5. Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt, and go to your working
   directory.
6. Make sure *cmake* and *git* are available in the Command Prompt.
   If they aren't, add them to the system PATH variable.

Getting and building from source:

1. Set up your environment.
2. Open a command prompt. Use git clone to check out a copy of
   HELICS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src.git
```

3. Go to the checkedout HELICS project folder (the default folder
   name is HELICS-src). Create a build folder and open the build
   folder. Alternatively, cmake-gui can be used.

```bash
cd HELICS-src
mkdir build
cd build
```

4. Run cmake. It should automatically detect where MPI is installed
   if the system path variables are set up correctly, otherwise you
   will have to set the cmake path manually. Optionally, you can use
   the option `-DAUTOBUILD_ZMQ=ON` to have cmake attempt to
   automatically download, build, and configure paths for a
   project-only copy of ZeroMQ.

```bash
cmake ..
```

If you need cmake to use a generator other than the default (ex:
selecting between a 32-bit or 64-bit project), the -G option can be
used to specify one of the generators listed by cmake --help. For
Visual Studio 2017, the generator name would be
`Visual Studio 15 2017 [arch]`, where \[arch\] is optional and can be
either Win64 for a 64-bit project, or left out to generate a 32-bit
project. To avoid problems when building later, this should match the
version of the Boost libraries you are using.

If you installed boost into the root of the C or D drives with the
default name (or the BOOST\_ROOT environment variable has been set),
cmake should automatically detect their location. Otherwise the
location will need to be manually given to cmake.

5. Open the Visual Studio solution generated by CMake. Under the
   *Build* menu, select *Build the Solution*. Alternatively, in the
   MSBuild command prompt, run the command msbuild HELICS.sln from
   the build folder to compile the entire solution. HELICS.sln can be
   replaced with the name of one of the projects to build only that
   part of HELICS.

Testing
-------

A quick test is to double check the versions of the HELICS player and
recorder (located in the buildsrchelicsplayerDebug folder):

```bash
> cd C:\Path\To\build\src\helics\player\Debug

> helics_player.exe --version
0.1

> helics_recorder.exe --version
0.1
```

Building HELICS with python support
-----------------------------------

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\local\helics-v1.0.0" -DBOOST_ROOT="C:\local\boost_1_65_1" -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python3-config --prefix)\include\python3.6m\ -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python3-config --prefix)\lib\python3.6m\libpython3.6m.dll ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```


Add the following to the Windows PYTHONPATH environment variable or run the following in the command line.

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=C:\local\helics-v1.0.0\python;%PYTHONPATH%
```

If you open a interactive Python session and import helics, you should be able to get the version of `helics` and an output that is similar to the following.

```bash
$ ipython
Python 3.6.4 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Jan 16 2018, 12:04:33)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: import helics

In [2]: helics.helicsGetVersion()
Out[2]: '1.0.0-alpha.3 (02-12-18)'

```
