# Linking with the HELICS Library

Once HELICS is built or installed it needs to be integrated into a project.  

## Language bindings
If the project is in Python, Matlab, Java, C#, Octave, or Julia, the language binding specific to that language is the best bet.

## C based project
The C based shared library is the way to go.

## C++98 or C++03.  
Then linking with the C shared library and using the C++98 header only wrapper is the most appropriate choice.

## C++14
If you are using C++14 and can install or generate the C++ shared library and make sure they are built with identical compilations configurations it is possible to link with the C++ shared library generated by HELICS.  This can provide a richer interface and potentially slightly faster interaction.
This can be done in a couple ways.  If the project is CMake based then HELICS will install a configuration file that generates the targets for the HELICS::helics-shared library with the appropriate information for linking,  This is the simplest approach.  Unlike the C shared library the C++ shared library requires the importing program to have the same compilation libraries since the library does not export std library symbols, or other symbols defined solely in header files, so those must have the same interpretation inside and out of the library for this to work.  

If you are using CMake and want to use static libraries or use the apps library as a static library then HELICS supports building as a subproject and direct linking.  


## Summary

-   For Python, Java, Matlab, C#, Octave, Julia  - use the defined interface
-   For C  use the C shared library
-   For Most C++ use the C++98 Wrapper to the C shared library
-   For C++14 in common build configurations use the C shared library or the C++ shared library from the installers or build it yourself to ensure library compatibility. 
-   For specific C++ applications desiring static build and using CMAKE use HELICS as a subproject in CMake ( The main use is some helics extensions, but other applications can use it as well)

-   For other languages - work with swig or use the foreign language capabilities of the language to import the C shared library.
