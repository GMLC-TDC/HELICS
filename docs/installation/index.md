Installation
============

The first step to using HELICS is to install it.
You’ll need an internet connection to run the commands in this chapter, as we’ll be downloading HELICS from the internet.

We’ll be showing number of commands as code snippets in the following presentation using a terminal, and those lines all start with `$`.
You don’t need to type in the `$` character; they are there to indicate the start of each command.
Lines that don’t start with `$` are typically showing the output of the previous command.


```eval_rst
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    windows
    mac
    linux
```
