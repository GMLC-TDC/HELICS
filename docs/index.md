This is the documentation for Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale
Infrastructure Co-Simulation (HELICS) framework. HELICS is a new
open-source cyber-physical-energy co-simulation framework for electric
power systems. HELICS is designed to support very-large-scale (100,000+
federates) co-simulations with off-the-shelf power-system,
communication, market, and end-use tools. HELICS is intended to be a
cross platform tool with the integration of both event driven and time
series simulation.
