# Support

If you're having trouble with understanding what HELICS does, how to use HELICS, getting a specific feature to work, or trouble-shooting some aspect of a HELICS-based co-simulation; there are a variety of support mechanisms we offer.

- [**Documentation**](https://docs.helics.org/en/latest/) - Though you're already here at the documentation site, the following pages may be of particular interest:

  - [Installation Guide](./installation/index.md) - Help with getting HELICS installed with the correct options for your particular use case
  - [User Guide](./user_guide/index.md) - Comprehensive guide to understanding and using HELICS covering both the [fundamentals](./user_guide/co-simulation_overview.md) as well as more [advanced topics](./user_guide/broker_hierarchies.md).
  - [API reference](./user_guide/index.md) - HELICS is written in C++ with many supported language bindings. The C++ Doxygen is the most comprehensive reference for the HELICS API

- **User Forum (forthcoming)** - Once Github moves their forums feature out of beta we'll implement it to provide a space where user's can discuss their HELICS use cases and get support on how to use HELICS.

- [**Bug Reports/Support**](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS/issues) - If HELICS doesn't appear to be working as expected, this is the place to file a bug report and get some help.

- **Examples, Use Cases, and Tutorials** - Over the years there have been a number of different public examples, use cases, and demonstrations of HELICS. These may be useful to show how particular features work or as a starting point for your use of HELICS.

- **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPa81c4BVXEYXt2EShTzbcg/featured)** - HELICS developers have created a number of short lectures and tutorials about how HELICS works and how to use it.

- **[Gitter](https://gitter.im/GMLC-TDC/HELICS)** - Live chat with developers (when they're logged in) for quick fix support.

- **Virtual Office Hours** - HELICS developers have periodic open office hours where anybody can come and get hands-on help with understanding HELICS better or getting a particular feature to work. Contact xxxxxxx for an invitation.
