 - rework of testing executables to reduce builds

### Improvements
 - some initial performance testing and improvements
 - exploration of more general convergence algorithms
 - increased testing of queries and timing and error conditions

 - a routing broker to connect different communication types and brokers together in the same federation

### Improvements

 - Major API changes based on feedback and initial broader usage
 - Change C interface to use an error object instead of return code and corresponding updates to the Interface API's
 - Initial performance and scalability testing
 - relaxed subscription/endpoint registration requirements
